      "The question is not explicitly stated in the text, but based on the context of the Adverse Events Reporting Guidelines for Healthcare Professionals, it can be inferred that the answer refers to therapeutic goods.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the guidelines, there is no specific mention of \"drugs\" being restricted to sale only with a prescription from a registered medical practitioner. However, section 7.1.2 mentions that products which are classified as Class A or Class B under the Drugs and Medicines Ordinance (DMO) should not be sold without a valid prescription.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Pakistan, Class A and Class B drugs are typically those that require a prescription for sale due to their potential for abuse, dependency, or other safety concerns. Examples of such drugs might include controlled substances, such as opioids or sedatives, as well as certain medications used to treat psychiatric disorders or addictive diseases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Examples of such restricted drugs in Pakistan would include:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Opioids (e.g., morphine, oxycodone)* Benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam, alprazolam)\n",
      "* Stimulants (e.g., amphetamines, methylphenidate)\n",
      "* Certain psychiatric medications (e.g., risperidone, aripiprazole)\n",
      "\n",
      "Please note that this is not an exhaustive list, and the specific drugs restricted to sale only with a prescription from a registered medical practitioner may vary depending on local regulations and guidelines.\n",

      "  Chatbot Answer: \n",
      "The text does not provide information on the fine imposed for selling a drug labeled as \"Physician Sample – Not for Sale\". However, I can tell you that according to the DRA Guidelines, selling a drug labeled as \"Physician Sample – Not for Sale\" is considered an offense and is punishable under the law. The exact penalty or fine imposed would depend on the specific circumstances and the laws in place at the time of the incident.\n",
